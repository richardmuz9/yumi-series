every file should under 3000 lines, once bypassed, create new file under same directory
# Throttle rapid requests
- maxRequests: 5          # allow up to 5 requests
- interval: 60s           # per 60-second window
- onExceedMessage: |
    ðŸš¦ Rate limit exceeded.  
    Please wait until the current 60 s window resets before sending more requests.

# Implementation
#  1. Count each chat/command+k invocation.
#  2. If you go over 5 within 60 s, block further calls and show onExceedMessage.

#  3. After 60 s from the first of that batch, reset the counter.
